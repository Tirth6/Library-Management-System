# Library-Management-System
This project focuses on analyzing and managing library data using SQL by answering real-world operational questions. The system evaluates book inventory, borrowing activity, authorship, and publisher performance across multiple library branches.

Key analyses include:

- Counting the number of books and copies available in each library branch
- Identifying books based on specific naming patterns and author name conditions
- Analyzing borrower activity within a defined date range
- Calculating the number of books written by each author
- Determining which publishers publish the most, least, or no books
